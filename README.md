Souq website : 
I used C#11 & .Net 7 with EF 8 and microsoft identity.
The user can see all the categories of all products from home page and search for any item or any category he want.
The user also can see all the recently added products and can see the offers.
All the website offers is make 25% discount of the price of any product.
User can add / remove products into the shopping cart and finally can pay using the paypal payment method.
The application has two roles admin,user.
Admin manages all products including add, update and remove them.
Admin also manages roles and all users.
Admin can see all completed orders.
